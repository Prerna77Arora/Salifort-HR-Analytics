# 🏢 Salifort Motors: Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
I completed an **employee attrition prediction project** for **Salifort Motors**, a mid-sized automotive company.  
The goal was to **analyze employee data** and **predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company**.  

By identifying key drivers of turnover, Salifort Motors can **improve retention strategies**, **reduce hiring costs**, and **enhance employee satisfaction**.

## 🏢 Background
**Client:** Salifort Motors (Fictional Company)  
- Mid-sized automotive manufacturing company  
- Facing increasing employee turnover, affecting productivity and costs  

**Business Challenge:**  
High attrition leads to:  
- Increased recruitment and training costs  
- Knowledge loss and reduced operational efficiency  

**Objective:**  
Use **machine learning** to predict **which employees are likely to leave**, and provide **insights for HR** to improve retention.

## 🎯 Project Goals
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Understand the distribution of employee attributes  
   - Compare characteristics of employees who stayed vs. left  

2. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values and categorical variables  
   - Encode and scale features for modeling  

3. **Machine Learning Modeling:**  
   - Build classification models including **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**  
   - Tune hyperparameters using **RandomizedSearchCV**  
   - Evaluate models with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**  

4. **Insights & Recommendations:**  
   - Identify top factors contributing to attrition  
   - Recommend HR strategies for retention
